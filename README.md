# molecule

This repository is undergoing a major overhaul. It will soon be a monorepo with installable packages like you're used to, with the option to "eject" when you want full control over the internals.

Until then, if you're curious about what kind of code is generated by the [Molecule Assembler](https://assemble.molecule.dev), you can check out the [`mlcl-9239f003850cf8b8c8bdc881b5c2e93853b6fb58` branch](https://github.com/molecule-dev/molecule-app/tree/mlcl-9239f003850cf8b8c8bdc881b5c2e93853b6fb58).

To get started assembling your own fully functional, full-stack, cross-platform applications, visit [assemble.molecule.dev](https://assemble.molecule.dev).

Also see the Molecule.dev CLI, [`mlcl`](https://github.com/molecule-dev/mlcl).
